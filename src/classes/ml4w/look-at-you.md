## Description

"Look At You" is an interactive art installation crafted to enhance self-appreciation and bring a touch of joy to daily routines. This experience draws inspiration from the daily ritual of grooming and preparing oneself in front of a mirror, whether for work, school, or social engagements. The authors believe that a genuine smile - born from joy and humor - is true beauty. Our goal is to inspire it to happen, and reflect this expression back to the user. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms from ml5, the installation recognizes facial and hand movements, allowing participants to amusingly alter their facial features in real time. This interaction is facilitated through a 70-inch screen paired with a webcam, producing life-sized, dynamic reflections. For those interested in bringing this unique blend of art and technology into personal or professional spaces, we offer a Mac-compatible version of the installation. We recommend placing it at entrances or environments with a lighthearted atmosphere. Experience "Look At You" and let a simple smile transform your day.
